# 🧮 Calculator Project 🧮

Welcome to my Calculator project! This project showcases a functional calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## 🛠️ Project Overview

I started this project with HTML and CSS to build the structure and style the user interface. I then added JavaScript to implement the calculator's functionality.

## ✨ Purpose

The primary goal of this project was to understand how to implement calculator logic using JavaScript. Throughout the development process, I learned and implemented the following features:

- **Add Event Listeners**: Capture user input through buttons and perform corresponding actions.
- **Reset Values and Add Decimal**: Include functionality to clear the display, reset values, and handle decimal points.
- **Operator Functionality and Calculations**: Implement arithmetic operations and update the display with results.

## 📚 What I Learned

- **JavaScript Event Handling**: Enhanced my skills in adding and managing event listeners to capture user interactions.
- **DOM Manipulation**: Gained experience in dynamically updating the DOM based on user input and calculations.
- **Arithmetic Logic**: Improved my understanding of implementing arithmetic operations and handling edge cases in calculations.
